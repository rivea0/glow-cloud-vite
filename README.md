<h2>Glow Cloud</h2>
<p><em>Daily weather report with a *slightly* absurd take</em>.</p>
</p>
</div>

### What is it?
A Pure React weather app built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) that gives current and daily weather forecasts, with additional information on the Sun. 

And the Moon, but it doesn't say much.

<br>

The theme is inspired by the podcast [Welcome to Night Vale](https://www.welcometonightvale.com/).

You can rate the weather although there is not much point to it.

"A Note for Today" section displays a random quote, mostly chosen from or inspired by the podcast or its Twitter account [@NightValeRadio](https://nitter.net/NightValeRadio/), but some of them mine. The source of the quote is given where it is used.

All hail the mighty Glow Cloud!
